# AirBattle

A group work of the 4º week of bootcamp, we received the challenge of create a game just using the Simple Graphic´s Library and delivered the first stable version in 10 days.

We developed a game inspired by Atari's classic River Raid, where the player has to dodge obstacles, shoot enemies and manage your fuel.
